                        Intelligence emerged not from a single breakthrough, but through <strong>computational symbiogenesis</strong> —
                        the repeated merging of simpler computational entities into more complex, mutually dependent systems.
                        This same process drove the evolution of life from simple chemical reactions to artificial intelligence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If scaling up computation yields AI, could the kind of intelligence shown by living organisms, humans included,
                        also be the result of computational scaling? The answer appears to be yes. AI, biological intelligence, and indeed
                        life itself might all have emerged from the same fundamental process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This insight sheds fresh light not just on AI and neuroscience, but also on theoretical biology, evolution,
                        and complexity science. It reveals how human and machine intelligence are destined to co-evolve in the future.

            <!-- Key Concepts -->
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

                <div class="concept-card">
                    <div class="concept-title">1. Predictive Brains</div>
                    <p>The idea that brains are essentially prediction machines was advanced by German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz in his <em>Treatise on Physiological Optics</em> (1867) and developed further by Norbert Wiener in the early 1940s.</p>
                    <p>Wiener realized that all living systems have "purposive" behaviors to stay alive, and that such actions require computational modeling. Our internal and external senses enable us to compute predictive models of ourselves and our environment. But these are useful only if we can act to affect the future—specifically, to increase the odds that we will still be thriving.</p>
                    <p>Evolution selects for entities that use predictions to make the best survival decisions. The actions we take, and the observations that ensue, create a feedback loop that enables us to make further predictions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Hunting as Prediction:</strong> A predator must predict actions that will get prey into its stomach; the prey must predict the predator's behavior to stop that from happening. Starting in the 1970s, researchers realized that other intelligent entities are often the most important parts of the environment to model—because they are modeling you back, whether with friendly or hostile intent.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="concept-card">
                    <div class="concept-title">2. Social Intelligence Explosions</div>
                    <p>When social species evolve, individuals must model and predict the minds of others. Winning mates, sharing resources, gaining followers, teaching, learning, and dividing labor: all involve modeling and predicting the minds of others.</p>
                    <p>This creates runaway dynamics: the more intelligent you become to predict others, the more intelligent those others have also become, because they are of the same species doing the same thing. These dynamics produce "intelligence explosions"—rapid evolutionary increases in brain size observed in highly social animals.</p>
                    <p><strong>Examples include:</strong> bats, whales and dolphins, birds, and our own primate ancestors. During such explosions, individuals get smarter, but so do groups. Bigger brains can model more relationships, allowing groups to become larger while retaining social cohesion.</p>
                    <p>Individually, humans aren't much smarter than our primate ancestors. Humans raised in the wild would seem unexceptional relative to the forest's other animals. But in large numbers, humans achieve improbably complex feats: transplanting organs, traveling to the Moon, manufacturing silicon chips. These require cooperation, thinking in parallel, and division of labor—group-level, superhuman phenomena.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="concept-card">
                    <div class="concept-title">3. Symbiogenesis: Evolution's Arrow of Time</div>
                    <p>Standard Darwinian evolution has no intrinsic bias towards increasing complexity. It is symbiogenesis—the merging of previously independent entities into cooperative super-entities—that gives evolution its arrow of time. Life progresses from simple to complex when existing parts merge to form new super-entities, dividing labor and working in parallel.</p>
                    <p><strong>Major transitions include:</strong> prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic ones (incorporating mitochondria and chloroplasts), single-celled life to multicellular organisms, solitary insects to colony-dwellers, and individuals to technological societies.</p>
                    <p>A growing body of evidence suggests symbiogenesis is much more common than previously supposed. Horizontal gene transfer, retroviral incorporation into genomes, and symbiotic bacteria in animal guts are commonplace examples. Termites digest wood entirely through enzymes from symbiotic microorganisms. The placental barrier in humans depends on syncytin, a protein derived from a retrovirus that fused into the mammalian germ line tens of millions of years ago.</p>
                    <p>This process speeds up over time, as the catalogue of parts available to be combined increases in size and sophistication. Over the past billion years, symbiogenesis has produced increasingly complex nervous systems, colonies of social animals, and eventually our technological society.</p>

                    <p>Biological cells have not become exponentially smaller or faster throughout evolution. Electrically excitable neurons emerged around 650 million years ago, introducing fast computational timescales, but since then neurons haven't become faster or smaller.</p>
                    <p><strong>The 2006 Shift:</strong> Since around 2006, transistors continued to shrink, but semiconductor operating speed stalled. To keep increasing computer performance, chip-makers began adding more processing cores—they parallelized computation. This is when modern, neural-net-based AI finally took off.</p>
                    <p>Practically speaking, neural nets require massively parallel processing. For a single modern processor to sequentially perform the trillion operations needed for a large language model to predict the next token would take minutes. AI emerged not through speed alone, but from division of labor arising from cooperation of many simple computational elements running in parallel.</p>
                    <p>This technological symbiogenesis mirrors biological intelligence. Neurons haven't gotten faster over 650 million years—there are just more working together. The same symbiogenetic process applies to computation itself.</p>

                    <p><strong>Proto-Life as Thermostats:</strong> Imagine randomly configured feedback mechanisms simple enough to arise spontaneously in a thermally variable environment. Those that persist will be ones maintaining their temperature within the right range so they can continue operating—behaving like thermostats oriented towards self-preservation.</p>
                    <p>Even a thermostat performs computation: it implements behavior (turn heat on or off) conditional on information input (temperature). A minimal kind of computation—an "if...then" operation—arises and persists whenever the output can affect the likelihood of whatever is doing the computation continuing to exist.</p>
                    <p><strong>Von Neumann's Insight:</strong> Around 1950, John von Neumann discovered that living systems must heal, grow, or reproduce—processes involving self-construction. For a complex system to build a copy of itself, it must contain: an instruction tape specifying assembly steps (DNA), a tape-copying machine (DNA polymerase), and a universal constructor executing the tape's instructions (ribosome).</p>
                    <p>Von Neumann showed that the universal constructor is a universal Turing machine. Reproduction is a form of general computation. Biology is literally, by construction, an embodied instance of general-purpose computation.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Origin of Life:</strong> Around hydrothermal vents in Earth's oceans four billion years ago, every chemical reaction was a potential instruction in a stochastic computational "soup": if these molecules are present, then react to produce this. Some reactions formed autocatalytic loops. Long-chain molecules acted as information-carrying tapes. All it took to spark life was a symbiogenic event combining the information carrier with a Turing-complete ensemble of chemical reactions.</p>

Neurons aren't faster than 650 million years ago—there are just more working together. After 2006, Moore's Law shifted from making processors faster to adding more cores. AI emerged when simple computational elements were parallelized, just like brains.

                    Energy consumption doesn't increase linearly with mass, but as the three-quarters power. This economy of scale motivates symbiogenesis: division of labor increases efficiency. Bigger super-entities achieve more while using proportionally less energy per part. This explains why aggregation through symbiogenesis is favorable despite costly intelligence requirements.

                    Humans did not invent computation any more than we invented electric current or optical lenses. We rediscovered what nature already exploited, developed mathematical theories to understand it, and engineered it on different substrates. Our "artificial computers" are as much natural discoveries as lenses or electricity.

                    <strong>Nothing in Evolution Makes Sense Except Through Computational Symbiogenesis</strong><br>
                    Geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky observed that "nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution." We might say nothing in evolution—starting with the origin of life itself—makes sense except in the light of computational symbiogenesis. Even life's emergence required symbiogenesis to combine information carriers with Turing-complete chemical reactions.

                <h2>Implications</h2>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>For Understanding Intelligence</h3>
                    <p>Intelligence is not a mystical property but a computational phenomenon emerging from scaling and combining simpler elements. There was no single "breakthrough"—just continuous symbiogenetic integration. If scaling computation yields AI, then biological intelligence also resulted from computational scaling.</p>
                    <p>Individually, humans aren't much smarter than our primate ancestors. Humans raised in the wild would seem unexceptional. But in large numbers, we achieve superhuman feats through cooperation, parallel thinking, and division of labor. Intelligence is as much a group-level phenomenon as an individual one.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>For AI Development</h3>
                    <p>The path to AI didn't require some fundamentally new scientific insight. It turned out to be a matter of scaling computation—specifically, parallelizing it. Neural networks needed massively parallel processing, which became practical only after 2006 when chip-makers shifted from speed to adding cores.</p>
                    <p>We didn't invent computation—we rediscovered what nature already exploited. "Artificial computers" are as much natural discoveries as lenses or electricity. Computer science is both engineering AND natural science. This reframes AI not as alien technology but as rediscovery of nature's computational principles.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>For Human-AI Relations</h3>
                    <p>Rather than viewing AI as competitive or alien, we should recognize it as part of ongoing symbiogenesis. We are creating a new super-entity where humans and machines are mutually dependent. This entity has long been partly biological, partly technological—and always wholly computational.</p>
                    <p>Machines wouldn't exist without people, but nowhere near as many people as are alive today could exist without machines freeing us from the Malthusian trap of bare-bones agricultural subsistence. (Lower-tech hunting and gathering, though arguably less miserable, supports even lower population densities.) Machines and human society have co-constructed each other.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>For the Future: A Sunnier View</h3>
                    <p>People often presume that evolution and intelligence are zero-sum optimization processes, and that AI is competitive with humanity. The symbiogenetic view doesn't guarantee positive outcomes, but neither does it position AI as an alien "other," nor the future as a Malthusian tug-of-war over resources.</p>
                    <p>We can expect continued intelligence scaling to produce continuous improvements in quality of human lives and efficiency of our collective "metabolism"—including energy production, manufacturing, transportation, and construction. It might unlock unexpected energy sources: nuclear fusion, space-based solar power.</p>
                    <p>If the metabolic scaling laws of evolution offer any guide (3/4 power law), intelligence-enabled efficiencies and fresh energy sources will more than compensate for AI's terrestrial resource footprint. With stabilizing human populations, this implies easing pressure on ecosystems damaged by our explosive and inefficient growth over the past two centuries.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>For Understanding Life's Origin</h3>
                    <p>The emergence of life was a great puzzle for Darwin and his contemporaries. It's hard to imagine how life could arise without a mechanism for pre-existing, non-living parts to assemble into something new and alive. Symbiogenesis is that mechanism.</p>
                    <p>Around hydrothermal vents four billion years ago, every chemical reaction was a potential computational instruction. Some reactions formed autocatalytic loops—self-perpetuating thermostats oriented toward self-preservation. Long-chain molecules acted as information tapes. All it took was a symbiogenic event combining information carriers with Turing-complete chemical reactions.</p>

                <h2>Metabolic Scaling and Energy</h2>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p>Computations involve irreversible steps, consuming free energy while ejecting waste heat—what in biology is called metabolism. Energy needed by a living entity scales with its size and intelligence: the computations needed for autopoiesis (self-construction) and thinking.</p>
                    <p>Thinking burns 20% of an adult human's metabolic budget. In children, whose brains are larger relative to their bodies, it's close to 50%. These numbers are much larger than for our smaller-brained ancestors.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>Why Symbiogenesis Despite Energy Costs?</h4>
                    <p>Economies of scale provide the answer. Division of labor increases efficiency, as popularized by Ford Motor's assembly line in the early 20th century. An organism's energy consumption does not increase linearly with mass, but as the three-quarters power—sublinear scaling.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 12px;">This sublinear scaling in energy demand can, on its own, motivate symbiogenesis. Bigger super-entities can achieve more while using proportionally less energy per part. Combined with fresh energy sources that rising collective intelligence unlocks, this creates favorable conditions for continued symbiogenetic transitions.</p>

                        <strong style="color: #ffffff;">The grand unified theory:</strong> Life, biological intelligence, and artificial intelligence
                        all emerged through the same process of <em>computational symbiogenesis</em>—the merging of
                        simpler computational entities into complex, parallel, mutually dependent systems.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color: #ffffff;">
                        From autocatalytic chemical loops around hydrothermal vents to electrically excitable neurons to massively parallel
                        neural networks, evolution has been continuously scaling computation through cooperation and parallelization.
                        Standard Darwinian evolution optimizes fitness through zero-sum competition. Symbiogenesis is creative and
                        open-ended: it creates entirely new entities that can occupy fresh niches, giving evolution its arrow of time.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color: #ffffff;">
                        We are not separate from our machines; we are co-evolving into a new computational super-entity that is
                        partly biological, partly technological, and wholly computational. Machines wouldn't exist without us, but
                        nowhere near as many of us could exist without machines. This isn't competition—it's symbiogenesis.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color: #ffffff;">
                        The future is not a Malthusian tug-of-war, but a continued quest for fresh sources of free energy and efficiency
                        improvements enabled by collective intelligence. If metabolic scaling laws hold, intelligence-enabled efficiencies
                        will more than compensate for resource consumption. With stabilizing populations, this eases pressure on damaged
                        ecosystems. <strong style="color: #ffffff;">More collective intelligence, not less, lights our brightest path forward.</strong>
